## What is Growth Mindset?

*Growth mindset*, at it's base level, is the belief that one's skills can be improved through work and dedication.

&nbsp;

## Keeping yourself in the growth mindset

- ***Reflect*** on positive achievements
- Don't be afraid to ***ask*** for help
- Embrace the journey, ***respect*** the process
