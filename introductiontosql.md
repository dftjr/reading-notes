# Introduction to SQL

## Definitions:

To start off we need to define both of the following: RDB's and SQL.

- A relational database (RDB) is basically just a way of sorting data into tables, columns, and rows. A perfect example would be storing information on an Excel spreadsheet, Excel itself acts like a RDB since the structure of it is based around setting data into columns and rows.
- Structured Query Language (SQL) is the most common language used in the industry to extract and organize data being stored in RBD's. It is argued to be the most important tool to programmers when it comes to data analytics and data science.

## Summary of reading:
Companies use RDB's as a way to help structure and store massive amounts of data in file structures that need to be sorted, as certain data may only pertain or link up to other subsequent data. With that though, you also need something to help easily retrieve that same data when it's needed, sometimes you just need to retrieve certain pieces as well. So how do you pull specific data from a massive volume of data in an easy way? That's where SQL comes in.
One, if not the most, commonly used language to do this is SQL. MySQL being one of the most used tools is what is used to grab and sort the data that the developer wants to retrieve. SQL has three phases:

- Parsing: Checks the syntax
- Binding: Checks the semantics of the query
- Optimization: Generates the query's execution plan

What can SQL do? Here's a list of just a few things it's capable of:

- Update records
- Delete records
- Insert records
- Retrieve data
- Create new databases, tables, rows, and columns

SQL is a very critical language to have for databases, as it helps cut down on the time and help improve efficiency when it comes to parsing and retrieving copious amounts of data. Below are some screenshots of some examples of what SQL can do:
