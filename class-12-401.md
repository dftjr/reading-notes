## Web Sockets

**What is a Web Socket?**

- It's a computer communications protocol.

**Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.**

- The client sends a request, then the server returns a handshake back.

**Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.**

- Request.

## Socket.io Tutorial

**What does the event handler io.on() do?**

- It sets an argument that can be emitted later on.

**Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected.**

    io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    socket.emit("hello", "world");
    });

     // client-side
    socket.on("hello", (arg) => {
      console.log(arg); // world
    });

**What does socket.emit() do?**

- Emit calls the previous set io.on's arguments.

## Socket.io vs Web Sockets

**What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).**

- WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides a bidirectional communiction between a server and a client. This is over a TCP connection.

**When would you use Socket.IO?**

- Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time cmmunications between the web servers and a client.

**When would you use WebSockets?**

- When you need an application that works best with full-duplex communication over TCP connections.

## OSI Model Explained

**What are a couple of key takeaways from this video?**

- It talks about the multiple levels of the OSI model. App being on the top end, where as TCP connections fall at the lower levels.

## TCP Handshakes Explained

**Translate the gist of this video to a non-technical friend.**

- It's like calling a friend on the phone, the signal goes to a cell tower that is managed by your phone provider. The phone tower registers the request and sends the signal to the person being called. A line of communication is then opened up between the two parties once the call is accepted.
