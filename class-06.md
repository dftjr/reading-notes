## JavaScript Object Basics

**How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**

- An object is a collection of different variable and functions. A way to describe with would be, haveing a box (object) and throwing in a bunch of harddrives (variables/data) and a bunch buisness cards with information of vendors you would call for specific jobs (functions).

**What are some advantages to creating object literals?**

- Convenience
- Flexability
- Declaration

**How do objects differ from arrays?**

- Objects represent a "thing" in your code
- Arrays represent a "collection" of data in a single variable

**Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.**

- You would need to use bracket when trying to access properties that contain special characters ones using variable

**Evaluate the code below. What does the term <code>this</code> refer to and what is the advantage to using <code>this</code>?**

- <code>this</code> is used to to refer to the object in the code "dog". You can use this to refer directly to the data inside the object itself

- It stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the document as nodes and objects
