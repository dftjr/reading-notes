# Reading Notes Class 14b

## What I learned

- It's interesting seeing how the outcome of tasks getting done by groups heavily relies on how that team themselves work together as a collective unit.
If teammates aren't able to work together, which also may include sacrificing certain things for the better of the group, the teams would tend to fail or do poorly on the task at hand.
 - It's also interesting to note how some team leaders will think they have a strong team, but find out after evaluators come in, that many teams aren't as solid as they think.
It seems like most people have a hard time telling people their honest opinions up font, and it seems like annoynmous questions tends to bring out the truth.
