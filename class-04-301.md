## React Docs - Forms

**What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**

- It's a component that becomes a single source of truth through React. The React component that renders the form asl controls what happens in that form.

**Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why**

- This data should be updated into state immediately, whether its a keystroke or a click. This keeps the data up to date and current so the webpage stays current with all the potential new data coming in from the user.

**How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**

- <code>this.state.value</code>

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

**Why would we use a ternary operator?**

- This does that same thing as writing the block of code normaly, but this helps condense the code into fewer lines and helps DRY it up a bit.

**Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**

- <code>x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);</code>
