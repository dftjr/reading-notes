# Reading Notes Trees

<br>

**Binary Trees (BTS) Explanation:**

Binary Trees restrict the number of children per node to two, these are referred to as the left and right children.
There is no specific order to the binary trees, letting nodes be added as long as there is space allowed.
Binary Trees are used primary because of their fast speed at insert and search, this makes them really good for directory problems.
These trees must be either empty or have a single node (at minimum).
