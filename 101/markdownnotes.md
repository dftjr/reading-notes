# What is Markdown?  

Markdown is plain text simple syntax that helps programmers quickly add formatting elements to text documents

If that explanation above was a little confusing, let me show you exactly what it means:

&nbsp;

> <--- Blockquotes (very popular on websites that contain comment sections)
> 
>> Using \* to italicize a word
>> 
>> *italicized*
>
>> Using \** to make a word bold
>> 
>> **bold**
>
>> Using \*** to make a word both italicized AND bold
>> 
>> ***italcized and bold***
>
>> Using \~~ to place a strikethrough over the word
>> 
>> ~~strikethrough~~
>
>> Creating Lists and sub-lists
>> 
>> - List
>>    - Sub-list

&nbsp;

These are only a handful of examples showing the simplicity of this language, pretty cool huh?
