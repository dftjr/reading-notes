<p> 

A mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values also known as variables.

### How does it pair with functions?

The () Operator invokes the Function. Not using () will produce the object, not the result of the function.

&nbsp;

Here is a table of some of the Operators found in JavaScript:

|    Variable                            |               Explination                                |
|      :---:                             |                  :---:                                   |
| Addition                               | Add two numbers (or strings) together                    |
| Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  | These follow the same rules of basic math                |
| Assignment                             | Assigns value to the variable                            |
| Strict Equality                        | Perfrms a test to see if values are equal, returns a T/F |
| Not, Does-Not Equal                    | Returns the logically OPPOSITE value of what is returned |

## Functions

<sup>*(Click for definition)*</sup>

<details>
<summary>Functions</summary>
<p> 

A block of code used to perform a particular task. Something must call/invoke the function in order to execute it.

</p>
</details>

&nbsp;

### Why use Functions?

Code can be reused, only needs to be defined once.
Use different arguements to get diferent results.

&nbsp;

### Invocation

Code executes inside the function when it gets called upon, here are some ways:

- When an event occurs, can be user enabled
- When it is invoked from JavaScript code
- Self-invoked

&nbsp;

### Return

A value is returned back to the user or invoker that called it. The function will stop executing once a return is presented.
