## react hello world

**What are the building blocks of a React app?**

- Elements
- Components

**What is the difference between an element and a React component?**

- Element: They are plain objects
- Component: They are like JS functions that return React elements to the screen

**What are some advantages of Reactâ€™s component based architecture?**

- Reusable components, call them when they are needed
- Written similar to JS functions, transition is easy

## introducing JSX

**What is JSX and why do we use it?**

- Syntax extension to JS, looks similar to template language bvut it's the full power of JS that helps in visual aid in describing what the UI should look like

**Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.**

- Anything placed inside <code>{ }</code> is returned in JSX

**Is it safe to embed user input in JSX? Explain.**

- Yes, the DOM handles what would be the potential issues before rendering

## rendering elements

**Explain what a React Component is to a non-technical friend.**

- It's something that can be used over and over again whenever asked of it, imagine an instruction manual to building a table, at any point in time during building that table you can review or call to that manual

**Describe mutability and React Components, specifically, how is the UI updated?**

- Components are immutable
- The DOM verifies any changes made within parent and children elements, this is where state comes in

**If changes are made to the UI, what does React update?**

- The state is updates, this holds values that the developer deems to be something that could potentially change based on actions taken by the client
