## Event Driven Programming

**What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**

- EventEmitter

**What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**

- While Object Oriented Programming focuseson the values and behavior inside of the object itself, Event Driven Programming, combined with it, helps allow the reverse flow of communication. This allows objects to emit the events, while not having to reach inside each one to trigger the functions, all of the objects behavior is contained within itself.

**Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**

- Imagine you have a mailroom, and you have process to sort, load, and send mail. Those process are completely seperate from each other, and each event just calls on the other one without having to figure out what going on side of the particular process.
