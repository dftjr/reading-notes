## Intro to JWT

**What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?**

- IT's an open standard (RFC 7516) that defines a compact way for securely passing information between parties as a JSON object.

**When should we use JSON Web Tokens?**

- When you have to transmit information in a secure way or authorization for users to be able to access specific routes and services.

**Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?**

- The payload.

## Are JWTs Secure?

**If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?**

- If you don't have the private key you can't change the contents. The receiver can tell if the signature no longer matches.

**If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, itâ€™s appended in the signature.**

- The Hash(payload + secret).

**Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.**

- Think of Adobe PDF's and the digital signature feature. You can send back edited PDF's and sign to lock the documents. If someone where to start editing the document without your knowledge and sent it back, your signature would no longer have a valid certificate, showing it was tampered with.

## JWTs Explained

**Why use JWT?**

- JSON is less verbose than some other types of encoding, this make it pass easier through HTML and HTTP environments. You can also use private key pairs for digital signatures.

**JWT is Compact and self-contained. Describe how this is useful to a non-technical friend.**

- It would be like having a portable tool kit that fits in your pocket, you have access to all the tools you need to get the job done, but it's also small and compact enough that you can bring it anywhere you want and it never becomes too overbearring.

**What are the three components (the structure) of a JWT signature?**

- Header
- Payload
- Signature
