# Reading Notes Implementation: Stacks and Queues

<br>

**What is a Stack?**

- The best way to describe a stack is like stacking a pile of plates on each other, when you stack a plate on the previous plate you are adding to the stack, when you remove a plate it leaves the stack. You can only remove the top plate, in practicality sense, the other plates are underneath so it makes it not possible. Last In First Out (LIFO).

**What is a Queue?**

- The best way to explain a queue is like waiting in a line at the DMV, when people enter the line they enter the queue, when the next person in line is called the first person that entered the queue is the first one out. The difference is that because the queue is open on both side, you can also removed the last person in line as well, or anyone in between. First In First Out (FIFO).
