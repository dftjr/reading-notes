# Reading Notes Implementation: Linked Lists

<br>

**What is a Linked List?**

- The best way to describe a linked list is imagine a rope laying on the ground, you tie a notch into rope (starting from left to right) which represents a node. As you tie more knots moving to the right you are creating more nodes, these nodes can only be connected to their left and right partners. It is not possible for them to connect to any other node as it is a fixed line.
