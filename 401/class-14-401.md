## Project Ideas

**Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.**

**Idea #1**

Auction website
- The idea of the site would be to have rooms where individuals (or the hsot) can post items up for auction. People within the rooms can bid on the item until the highest bidder is no longer being out-bid.

    - Timed auctions that increase when bid is placed
    - Chat for lobbies for bidders to either chat or watch the status of the item
    - Ways to switch rooms and bid on other items

**Idea #2**

Jukebox
- The idea would be to have a website that has multiple rooms with different genres of music playing. In each room people can enter and bid to increase the likelyhood of their pick of a song playing next.
    
    - Timer to track when music expires, next songs played automatically
    - Rooms persist even when no music is playing
    - Rooms have chat logs enabled
    - User select and bid on their or others songs
