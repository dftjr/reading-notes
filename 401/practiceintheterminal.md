## Summaries of the following topics:

### The Command Line
 
This is the terminal, or text based interface, to your computer's operating system (OS). You enter text to issue commands and in return the terminal will send you text back as a response. There is a thing called the "shell" that determines how the terminal behaves after a command is given, this is a part of the OS. There are many different shells that you can install, most do the same thing, it comes down to preference.

### Basic Navigation
 
In the terminal you can navigate around your file structure within your computer. There's not much to summarize in this area, as it's pretty self explanatory, but know that this is a quick way to move between files, view what's in them, and also list a tree to see the hierarchy of your file structures.

### More About Files
 
Everything on your computer is a file! What to know about this is that Windows for example is case insensitive while Linux is case sensitive, this makes a huge difference when it comes to navigating the terminal. You can also view hidden files and directories which would normally not be visible if you were just traditionally clicking through folders.

### Manual Pages
 
These are pages in the terminal that show the user the commands available to them for use, while also explaining to them what they do and how to execute them.

### File Manipulation
 
Within the terminal you can create, move, rename, delete, and so much more with the files on your computer. It is basically doing the same thing when you right-click a file and hit "delete", but now you're just doing it without all the normal cool fancy features. There's not too much more to summarize on this, just know, that in the terminal you have the power to manipulate most if not all of the file structures in your computer. Don't delete something that your OS needs to operate though!
