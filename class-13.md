## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

**Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?**

- HTTP is stateless, so data is not saved when you exit and re-load the application. You would use this to store data so when a particular user(s) re-open the application their data is store where they last left off.

**What information should not be stored in local storage?**

- Any kind of sensitive data that would would not want anyone to have access to, this includes personal data and logins/passwords

**Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?**

- Local storage can only store string data. You have to use the <code>JSON.stringify()</code> and <code>JSON.parse()</code> methods.
