## Exploring the Element

There are three things that make up and element in HTML:

- Opening tag - Where the element begins/starts to take effect
- Closing tag - Where the element ends/where the effect stops
- Content - The data inside of the opening and closing tags

## Types of Elements

There are hundreds of elements within HTML and all of them play an important role in structuring the content that is input.

### Semantic

These elements describe a specific purpose and the content within

Some examples:

- \<article>
- \<header>
- \<main>
- \<footer>
- \<nav>
