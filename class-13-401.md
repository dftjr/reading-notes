## Socket.io Chat Example

**Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.**

- It's basically acts like an IM chat where clients are connected to a room in which they can message each other.

**What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?**

- You see whenever a client connects through the console.log().

**Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?**

- <code>socket.broadcast.emit()</code>

## Rooms

**What is a room and how might a room be useful?**

- It's a channel in which multiple cliens can event and leave when they please. It also is in real-time, so every client in that room will see the same data presented as the others.

**How do you join a room?**

- <code>socket.join()</code>

**How do you leave a room?**

- <code>socket.leave()</code>

## Namespaces

**What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?**

- It's splits the communication through multiple channels that can allow the application to seperate whatever logic the developer decides to.

**Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)**

- Event handlers
- Rooms
- Middlewares

**Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces**

- You can create a space that only handles specific actions or if you wanted a channel where only clients with certain rights would have access to.
