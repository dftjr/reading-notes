## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

- Syntax error are spelling errors that cause you program to cease working
- Logic is when syntax is correct but the code itself it not doing what the creater intended it to do

**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

- Numerous times I've left curly brackets that won't get caught in syntax error because they are technically connecting to somethign else, which then in return, breaks part of the code. I've labled variables wrong before as well.

**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?*

- This will help me with keeping a good eye on attention to detail, especially in situations where it can be something that could break a whole chain of events.

## The JavaScript Debugger

**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

- It's a way of spot checking your code to see where errors are occuring for debugging help. It can watch variable values. You can also ppause the execution as well

**Define what a breakpoint is.**

- Placed points in the code that pauses code to help evaluate

**What is the call stack?**

- Shows what code was executed in order to get to the current line, pauses on the breakpoint
