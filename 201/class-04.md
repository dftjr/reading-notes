## CSS Layout

- The way that webpage elements lay themselves out if their layout hasn't changed.

**What are a few differences between <code>block-level</code> and <code>inline</code> elements?**

**Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**

- It sits above the layout on its own layer, which is useful for making UI features like pop-up boxes and control menus.
- It makes it easier to create the size and positioning of the element.

**What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**

- Absolute positioning fixes an element in place near its positioned ancestor.
- Fixed positioning fixes an element in place relative to the viasble position of the viewport (useful for UI's that need to stay in place).

## Miscellaneous

**Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

- Engaged collaboration
    -  This is benificial in learning things you may not have known. Collaboration is a great way to brainstorm new ideas and ways to approach projects.
- Social skills
    - This is an absolute must for me. I'm a firm believer that socail skills are very crucial to not just communication in general, but it absolutely helps with neworking in the job field.
