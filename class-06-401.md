## Securing Passwords

**Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password.**

- You encrypt the password in hash, which stores it as a non-plaintext password (the actual one) so if someone steals it, they only have access to the encrypted version.

**What is Bcrypt?**

- It is a type of encryption that helps prevent against brute force hacks, its slow but strong.

**Why might you use something like Bcrypt?**

- It uses key-stretching, which is a way to help defend against hacking attempts. It increases the work factor depending on the time span, this can be adjusted as hardware gets faster.

## Basic Auth

**What is Basic Authentication?**

- A method for the user agent to provide a user name an password when making a request.

**What properties are necessary in the header of a Basic Auth request?**

- Username and password combined with a single <code>:</code>.

**How are <code>username:password</code> in Basic Auth encoded?**

- A variant of Base64.

## OWASP auth cheatsheet

**Define the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter.**

- It is a process in checking to make sure the person logging in is the correct person, for example, when you go to the airport and security checks your passport and ticket to make sure you are the right person to be holding that ticket.

**How should your error messaging respond (both HTTP and HTML)? Why?**

- There should be no hints or clues to what the password or login could be, it should be very vague but while also showing what went wrong, for example, "wrong password entered".
