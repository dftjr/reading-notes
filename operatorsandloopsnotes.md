# Operators and Loops

&nbsp;

## Operators

A mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values also known as variables.

&nbsp;

## Types of Operators

- Assignment
- Comparison
- Arithmetic
- Bitwise
- Logical
- String
- Conditional
- Comma
- Unary
- Relational

&nbsp;

### Assignment Operators

Assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

<details>
<summary>Aissigning to Properties</summary>
<p> 

Lefthand side of an assignment expression can make assignments to that expressions properties. Happens when an expression evaluates to an object.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Destructuring</summary>
<p> 

Expression the makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax. Used on more complex assignments.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Evaluation and Nesting</summary>
<p> 

Can assign a result into another variable. That variable can then be placed inside, for example, a function call or an array.

</p>
</details>

&nbsp;

### Comparison Operator

Compares and returns a logical value based on whether or not the comparison is true. The operands can be:

- Numerical
- String
- Logical
- Objects

Two operands cannot be th same type (most senerios).

Table of Comparison operators:

|    Operator              |               Description                                                      |
|      :---:               |                  :---:                                                         |
| Equal (==)               | Returns true if the operands are equal                                         |
| Not Equal (!=)           | Returns true if the operands are not equal                                     |
| Strict Equal (===)       | Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type                    |
| Strict Not Equal (!==)   | Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal                |
| Greater Than             | Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand             |
| Greater Than or Equal to | Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand |
| Less Than                | Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand                |
| Less Than or Equal to    | Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand    |

## Loops

Loops offer a way to quickly repeat something. Loops repeat an action chosen number of times. There a various ways to loop code depending on the type of data being commited and pulled.

&nbsp;

List of the statements below:

- For
- Do...while
- While
- Labled
- Break
-Continue
- For
- For...of

&nbsp;

### For Statement

<details>
<summary>For</summary>
<p> 

Repeats until a specified condition comes back as false.

</p>
</details>

&nbsp;

What happens when a For statement is executed:

1. Initializing expression is executed (can declare variables).

2. The condition expression is evaluated. If true the loop statements executes, if false the loop terminates.

3. The statement executes.

4. Update expression (if present) executes.

5. Control returns to the "second step" in this list.

&nbsp;

### While Statement

<details>
<summary>While</summary>
<p> 

Executes its statements as long as a specified condition equals true.

</p>
</details>

&nbsp;

What happens when a While statement is executed:

1. Condition test occurs before loop statement is executed.

2. If condition returns true, statement is executed.

3. Condition is tested again.

4. If condition returns aalse, execution stops, control gets passed to the statement following the While.
