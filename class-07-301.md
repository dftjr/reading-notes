## How I explained REST to my brother (Links to an external site.)

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

- He created the first web servers. Explained why the web works the way it does.

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

- They weren't originally desgined to be used like that. Primary concern used to be trying to get the computers to talk to each other.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

- It tells the browser what protocol to use. Basically GPS coordinates for the information its grabbing.

**What does a GET do?**

- Tells the browser to go and get the information required to show the whole webpage. It'll keep executing the GET until all attributes have been grabbed.

**What does a POST do?**

- It adds something

**What does PUT do?**

- It replaces something

**What does PATCH do?**

- It updates something
