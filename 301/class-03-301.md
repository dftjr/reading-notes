## React Docs - lists and keys

**What does .map() return?**

- It goes through the array checking each index one by one and returning a new array. Whilgoing through the indexes you can change the data inside with a function.

**If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?**

- You use curly braces with the function you are trying to render.

**Each list item needs a unique ____.**

- Key

**What is the purpose of a key?**

- It helps React determine which items have been altered or added/removed.

## The Spread Operator

**What is the spread operator?**

- Its a way to add/take away data from an array.

**List 4 things that the spread operator can do.**

- Combining arrays
- Combining objects
- Adding items to arrays
- Adding states within React

**Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.**

- arr1 = [1,2,3]
- arr2 = [4.5.6]
- let combineArr = [...arr1, ...arr2]

**Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.**

- arr1 = ['a','b','c']
- arr2 = ['e'.'f'.'g']
- let combineArr = [...arr1, 'd', ...arr2]
- 
**Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.**

- obj1 = {1,2,3}
- obj2 = {4.5.6}
- let combineArr = [...obj1, ...obj2]

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

**In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?**

- They created a function that will be passed to the component (child).

**In your own words, what does the increment function do?**

- It increase the selected data/argument by 1. Uses the Map() to go through the indexes and pass back a new array.

**How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?**

- You pass them using props to the state.

**How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?**

- You have to use this.props in order to call anything that exsists outside of the code where the state lies for the data.
